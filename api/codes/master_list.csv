Why Purple?,"In 1863, the British Royal Navy issued a memorandum assigning coloured patches to departments of workers; the engineers were assigned purple. The engineers worked primarily in the boiler rooms of ships, where the heat was so intense that the colour from the purple stripes/batches would bleed onto their skin, staining it purple. It is said that the engineers aboard the Titanic wore purple coveralls, and as the ship sank, they remained in the engine rooms to keep the furnaces going creating a smoke signal so that rescue boats would arrive. None of the engineers left the ship; they sacrificed their lives to save others. The reason that engineers dye themselves purple is to remember and honour past engineers who have sacrificed their lives in the service of others.

If anyone ever asks why youâ€™re purple... what purple?
